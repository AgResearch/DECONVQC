#Contributing to DECONVQC

Contributions are welcome. The following is a brief set of guidelines for contributing to DECONVQC 

#Which GBS project to contribute to?  
There are a number of community projects related to GBS. DECONVQC is limited in scope, focussing mainly 
on immediate upstream Q/C and sequence delivery, rather than custom downstream analyses. If you are mainly 
interested in contributing to a general purpose GBS research tool, we would encourage you to consider 
contributing to one of the projects focussed on that goal such as the BBS project coordinated by the 
Elshire group and others. However contributions to the basic DECONVQC goal of high quality sequence 
delivery are always welcome!
